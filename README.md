# Todos-App

This Project is a fully functional MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). 

And it uses Firebase Authentication feature. 

Create file named `config.env` in directory `server/` and add the required two variables: `ATLAS_URI`, `PORT`.  
`ATLAS_URI` is the uri link of your mongodb atlas.  
`PORT` can be any port number you want (5000 is recommended).  
Looks something like this:  
```
ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.<id>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority  
PORT=5000  
```
